<h1>Curriculum Vitae - Christopher Kummelstedt</h1>

<P>My name is Chris and I am 30 years old. I have lived in Sweden, The UK, China and The United States. Before starting coding I graduated with top grades from the best business school in the Nordic countries where I am about to start a phd.</P>

<P>For us to be a good fit you probably enjoy meeting people with different perspectives on your own (I live for that) and you dont mind if some of them are quite quirky. Too get the best value for your money you also most likely require someone that can lead a team.</P>

<P>My passion is "project managaemnt", a term that I think is way to clinical to capture the essence of a co-creative process. Over the years I have started music festivals in the UK, a language school in China, helped organise a summer school in rural South Africa, a social entrepreneurship hackathon in Stockholm and I have been the operations manager for an international NGO with offices in Botswana, Uganda and Namibia. This and many other team endeveours taught me a few key things about people and how we craft things together. </P>

<P>One; everyone must be seen and heard. That is both how the vision becomes as strong and realistic as possible, and how the team becomes endowed with the intrisic motivation necessary to build something beautiful. Secondly - as everything can be improved, stay perpetually in beta. Honor the permanent revolution. Take the time to reflect on wheter something is effective and not mearly efficient. Three, don't predict - try.</P>
